#  Frontend Code Challenge

## Setup

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

## Running

Update config.json with your Twitter API credentials.
Start the static and proxy servers:

`npm start`

This server will help you to get Twitter's API to send you tweets without you needing to do any authentication.  You don't need to modify server.js at all. 


```If you have trouble running the starter code on Window, please go into server.js file, change this line: var spawn = require(‘child_process’).spawn; to var spawn = require(‘child_process’).exec;```
